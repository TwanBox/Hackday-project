# Hackday-project -- Twan Boox
A one-day project as part of the &lt;/salt> full stack javascript bootcamp. Let the fun begin!

## requirements

- scoped for one day
- implement a front-end, I will go with React
- implement a back-end, I will use Node & Express
- live demo the next morning.

> keep it simple, improve in small increments, have fun!

## idea

TwanBoox, it's the hot new thing everyone talks about!
All readers around the world are now able to bring their entire library with them.
Users can explore the books of the world. start a new library, wishlist, collection; you name it!

### preparations

The first step would be making sure that I can actually access the google maps API. I have run a succesfull test. Second, fetching based on location and a specific kind of place.

- react, to create a single page application
- express server to fetch data
- API: Google books API tested with postman :)

### approach
